# Flag Wave Generator (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

This project provides a basic web interface for users to upload an image and conceptually generate a "waving flag" GIF from it. While the core image manipulation and GIF encoding for a realistic waving effect are complex and would typically require advanced libraries or server-side processing, this repository demonstrates the fundamental front-end structure using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

* **Image Upload:** Users can select and upload an image file (PNG, JPG, etc.).
* **Image Preview:** The uploaded image is displayed on a canvas for preview.
* **"Generate GIF" Button:** A button to trigger the (conceptual) GIF generation process.
* **GIF Output Area:** A section to display the generated GIF.
* **Download Button:** A link to download the generated GIF.
* **Basic Styling:** Clean and responsive user interface using vanilla CSS.

## How it Works (Conceptual)

1.  **User Uploads Image:** The `input type="file"` element allows users to select an image.
2.  **Image Preview:** JavaScript reads the uploaded file, creates an `Image` object, and draws it onto an HTML `<canvas>` element for a live preview.
3.  **"Generate" Button:** When clicked, this button initiates a simulated GIF generation process.
    * **Important Note:** The actual "waving flag" effect and GIF encoding are *not* fully implemented in this basic version. This would require:
        * **Image Distortion/Warping:** Applying mathematical transformations (e.g., sine waves) to the image's pixel data across multiple frames to simulate a flag waving. This is a computationally intensive task.
        * **GIF Encoding:** Using a JavaScript library (like `gif.js`) to compile these generated frames into an animated GIF file.
    * For demonstration purposes, a placeholder GIF is displayed after a short delay to simulate the generation process.
4.  **Download:** Once the GIF is "generated" (or the placeholder is shown), a download link becomes available.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**
    If you have Git installed:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url> # Replace with your actual repository URL if applicable
    cd flag-wave-generator-html-css-js
    ```
    Otherwise, download the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files into a single folder.

2.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Navigate to the folder where you saved the files and simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. Most modern browsers will allow you to run local HTML files directly.
